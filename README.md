# Calcio

Initial thoughts
- Read the instuctions
- TODO: Don't forget the extra points link below the kata page
- Do I have to validate the input?(to avoid rubbish/bad data input)
- String to integer manipulation we have to do for the input
- Avoid original input manipulation
- Need to benchmark the solution
- Small ruby app with minitest will be enough here
- If we have complex calculation then move that calculation into service object
- Add the comment so we can have proper rdoc
- Create the requirement file with all the details
- Try parslet gem instead of regex if it works without rails :(
