## üïê Benchmarking
Below are the result and output of benchmaring for big input 
```
Benchmark.bmbm do |x|
  x.report("Calcio Performance") {Calcio.add(Set.new(1..100000).join(','))}
end
Rehearsal ------------------------------------------------------
Calcio Performance   0.092679   0.005942   0.098621 (  0.098829)

                         user     system      total        real

PS: Just out of the curisity I tried to explore the parslet gem but getting worse result than this solution.

## ü§î Initial thoughts
1. Read the instuctions
2. TODO: Don't forget the extra points link below the kata page
3. Do I have to validate the input?(to avoid rubbish/bad data input)
4. String to integer manipulation we have to do for the input
5. Avoid original input manipulation
6. Need to benchmark the solution
7. Small ruby app with minitest will be enough here
8. If we have complex calculation then move that calculation into service object
9. Add the comment so we can have proper rdoc
10. Create the requirement file with all the details
11. Try [parslet gem](https://github.com/kschiess/parslet) instead of regex if it works without rails :(
